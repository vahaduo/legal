<h4>IllustrativeDNA considers all software it uses to be its intellectual property.</h4>
<p>The irony is that they prohibit copying it for commercial purposes and threaten to sue anyone who dares to do so.</p>

<h3><mark>IllustrativeDNA claims that thanks to them, Vahaduo tools have become unnecessary.</mark></h3>
<h4>On the 23andme subreddit, an IllustrativeDNA representative actively discouraged people from using Vahaduo tools.</h4>

<h3><mark>Calculation of license cost for IllustrativeDNA.</mark></h3>
<h4>I understand that IllustrativeDNA is not only about the tools used, but also about the large amount of work put into other aspects of the business . Therefore, I do not claim all the money earned, but only the proportion of it that would have accrued to me if I had been one of the large shareholders and the payouts would have been proportional to the amount of shares in the company.</h4>
<h4>Thus, the calculation is simple:</h4>
<p>Amount of shares:</p>
<p>0.425 / (0.425 + 0.425 + 0.425 + 0.15) = 0.425 / 1.425 = 0.298245614</p>
<p>Value of shares (at the same time cost of licence for 2021-2023):</p>
<p>€206818 * 0.298245614 = €61682,561396252</p>
<p>Estimated licence cost for 2024: no less than €40000.</p>
<h4>IllustrativeDNA owes me more than €100,000 in licence fees for the use of my work.</h4>
